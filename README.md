Certainly, I can help you improve the formatting and content of your README file. Here's a modified version:

# Getting Started with Bootstrap

This project serves as an introduction to using the Bootstrap framework.

## Folders Description

### Practice Folder

In the **Practice** folder, you'll find various experiments and explorations with Bootstrap features. This is a space for learning and trying out different functionalities.

### Egens_landing_page Folder

The **Egens_landing_page** folder is where we are building a website using an example from the Themeforest platform, specifically the "Egens" creative agency HTML template. You can preview the template [here](https://preview.themeforest.net/item/egens-creative-agency-html-template/full_screen_preview/37538358?_ga=2.99933982.1834253773.1696418468-1237112574.1696418468).

Feel free to explore these folders to learn and experiment with Bootstrap. Happy coding!
